 * The ProcessingAsAService interface defines the contract for services that process input streams or files based on specified options.
 * It outlines methods for executing tasks in parallel streams and for counting and printing elements (lines, words, characters, bytes) from an input stream.
 * Implementations of this interface are expected to handle the logic for processing input according to the options provided,
 * leveraging parallel processing where applicable to enhance performance.
