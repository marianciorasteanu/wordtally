## :abc: WordTally - Build Your Own wc Tool Coding Challenge
> https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc/

<br>

:arrow_forward: Printing newline, word, and byte counts for each input file and a total number of lines if more than one FILE is specified. 
A word is a non-zero-length sequence of printable characters delimited by white space.

:arrow_forward: In case there is no file as input, the app will read from standard input. 
Since this is a linux/unix command, this standard input,
which is created by another tool and redirected with pipe (|),
will be read from the stdin file descriptor of the process id of wordtally
(/proc/PID-number/fd/0).
